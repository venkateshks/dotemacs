* Brand new emacs config based off use-package
  Cleaning my 16 years old emacs config to make it easy to port to different
  machines
* Will cover the following in this config
  - Different progamming modes (python, C, C++, Clojure, Clojurescript)
    And finally a Java mode as well.
  - Org mode for pratically everything (todos, ppts, bookmarks)
  - Email, I have been a heavy gnus and mu4e user. Need to decide which way
    to go. Like some bits of both. But I like the notmuch approach of keeping
    mails in the server. That way I can keep my client machines thin. One of my
    machines is actually a x86 tablet with linux on it.
  - Emacs for my ledger
* The org files itself will be parked in a different private repo.
